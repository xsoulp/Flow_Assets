hector

scan (sensor_msgs/LaserScan)

    The laser scan used by the SLAM system. 

syscommand (std_msgs/String)

    System command. If the string equals "reset" the map and robot pose are reset to their inital state. 

Published Topics
map_metadata (nav_msgs/MapMetaData)

    Get the map data from this topic, which is latched, and updated periodically. 

map (nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid)

    Get the map data from this topic, which is latched, and updated periodically 

slam_out_pose (geometry_msgs/PoseStamped)

    The estimated robot pose without covariance 

poseupdate (geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped)

    The estimated robot pose with an gaussian estimate of uncertainty 

Services
dynamic_map (nav_msgs/GetMap)

    Call this service to get the map data. 

reset_map (std_srvs/Trigger)

    Call this service to reset the map, and hector will start a whole new map from scratch. Notice that this doesn't restart the robot's pose, and it will restart from the last recorded pose. 

pause_mapping (std_srvs/SetBool)

    Call this service to stop/start processing laser scans. 

restart_mapping_with_new_pose (hector_mapping/ResetMapping)

    Call this service to reset the map, the robot's pose, and resume mapping (if paused) 

Parameters
~base_frame (string, default: base_link)

    The name of the base frame of the robot. This is the frame used for localization and for transformation of laser scan data. 

~map_frame (string, default: map_link)

    The name of the map frame. 

~odom_frame (string, default: odom)

    The name of the odom frame. 

~map_resolution (double, default: 0.025)

    The map resolution [m]. This is the length of a grid cell edge. 

~map_size (int, default: 1024)

    The size [number of cells per axis] of the map. The map is square and has (map_size * map_size) grid cells. 

~map_start_x (double, default: 0.5)

    Location of the origin [0.0, 1.0] of the /map frame on the x axis relative to the grid map. 0.5 is in the middle. 

~map_start_y (double, default: 0.5)

    Location of the origin [0.0, 1.0] of the /map frame on the y axis relative to the grid map. 0.5 is in the middle. 

~map_update_distance_thresh (double, default: 0.4)

    Threshold for performing map updates [m]. The platform has to travel this far in meters or experience an angular change as described by the map_update_angle_thresh parameter since the last update before a map update happens. 

~map_update_angle_thresh (double, default: 0.9)

    Threshold for performing map updates [rad]. The platform has to experience an angular change as described by this parameter of travel as far as specified by the map_update_distance_thresh parameter since the last update before a map update happens. 

~map_pub_period (double, default: 2.0)

    The map publish period [s]. 

~map_multi_res_levels (int, default: 3)

    The number of map multi-resolution grid levels. 

~update_factor_free (double, default: 0.4)

    The map update modifier for updates of free cells in the range [0.0, 1.0]. A value of 0.5 means no change. 

~update_factor_occupied (double, default: 0.9)

    The map update modifier for updates of occupied cells in the range [0.0, 1.0]. A value of 0.5 means no change. 

~laser_min_dist (double, default: 0.4)

    The minimum distance [m] for laser scan endpoints to be used by the system. Scan endpoints closer than this value are ignored. 

~laser_max_dist (double, default: 30.0)

    The maximum distance [m] for laser scan endpoints to be used by the system. Scan endpoints farther away than this value are ignored. 

~laser_z_min_value (double, default: -1.0)

    The minimum height [m] relative to the laser scanner frame for laser scan endpoints to be used by the system. Scan endpoints lower than this value are ignored. 

~laser_z_max_value (double, default: 1.0)

    The maximum height [m] relative to the laser scanner frame for laser scan endpoints to be used by the system. Scan endpoints higher than this value are ignored. 

~pub_map_odom_transform (bool, default: true)

    Determine if the map->odom transform should be published by the system. 

~output_timing (bool, default: false)

    Output timing information for processing of every laser scan via ROS_INFO. 

~scan_subscriber_queue_size (int, default: 5)

    The queue size of the scan subscriber. This should be set to high values (for example 50) if logfiles are played back to hector_mapping at faster than realtime speeds. 

~pub_map_scanmatch_transform (bool, default: true)

    Determines if the scanmatcher to map transform should be published to tf. The frame name is determined by the 'tf_map_scanmatch_transform_frame_name' parameter. 

~tf_map_scanmatch_transform_frame_name (string, default: scanmatcher_frame)

    The frame name when publishing the scanmatcher to map transform as described in the preceding parameter.
